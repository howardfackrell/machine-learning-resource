##Examples
###example/flightdelay
This is the example from the Pluralsight video 'Understanding Machine Learning with R'. The data comes from the DOT. The exercise is to predict which flights will be delayed by 15 minutes or more.

###example/income
This dataset is from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/). The excercise is to predict whether individuals make more or less than 50,000.00 based on some demographics. There is a data file and a separate test file.
